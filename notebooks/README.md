## Setup and Installation

To run the notebooks locally, follow these instructions:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository-name.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the repository**:
   ```bash
   cd your-repository-name
   ```

3. **Set up the Python environment**:
   - It is recommended to use a virtual environment. Set up and activate it with:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
     ```

4. **Install the required packages**:
   - If a `requirements.txt` file is provided, install the packages with:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

5. **Start Jupyter Notebook**:
   - Launch Jupyter Notebook to access and execute the notebooks:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook
     ```

6. **Open the Notebooks**:
   - In Jupyter Notebook, open the Sierra Leone, Togo, and Benin analysis notebooks to interact with them.

## Data

Ensure that the datasets for Sierra Leone, Togo, and Benin are located in the `data/` directory before running the notebooks.

## Results

The analysis includes:
- **Data Cleaning**: Addressing missing values, outliers, and incorrect data.
- **EDA**: Summary statistics, distributions, correlations, and visualizations of key variables.
- **Visualization**: Graphs and charts illustrating data trends and insights.
